# Week-9-Test

**Name at least two things to check for debugging for when your code isn’t working (bonus points for more then two).**
1.) Go to input and not the code but go to where it says styles and that is one way you can see where your code is not working.
2.) To organize your javascipt and make it where style is in one place and script is in another part of your code.


**Why won’t this work? In your HTML: `<input class=”.some-element” type=“text” />` In your Javascript: `$(“.another-element”).val();`**

Well in the html it is suppose to look like this <input type=".some-element" type="text"/> The javacript $('.another-element').val();


**What’s the relationship between JavaScript and jQuery?**

The relationship is both of them are a type of code and the use the $ sign.


**What does `var name = $(‘.name-field’).val();` do?**

You can put in a pop up box and it lets the person put there name in it then you can code to make the computer put there name in a sentence.


**How do we make sure an element is hidden when the page is first loaded? Hint: you don’t need any javascript! How do we then unhide that element using javascript?**

If you wanted to show it using javascript it could be .show() Sorry but the other one I have forgotten sorry.


**What’s the difference between `$(‘#myElement’)` and `$(‘.myElement')'?**
The difference is .myElement is to identify something and the #myelement I do not know.
